## Proven Resume Structure

This structure helped one user land 7 interviews in 2 weeks without applying - recruiters reached out directly.

### 1. Professional Summary
- 3-4 sentences max
- Highlight experience, expertise, value proposition
- **This is what recruiters read first** - if they don't like it, they skip the rest

### 2. Skills
- Bulleted or two-column layout
- Mix of technical and soft skills
- Use keywords from job postings in your industry

### 3. Licenses & Certifications
- Credential name
- Issuing organization
- Date earned (if recent)

### 4. Professional Experience
```
[Job Title]
Company Name — City, State
Month/Year – Month/Year

• Key responsibility or achievement #1
• Key responsibility or achievement #2
```

**Rules:**
- Maximum 7 bullet points per role
- One sentence each
- Quantify results: "Reduced processing time by 30%"
- Focus on transferable skills

### 5. Projects/Achievements (Optional)
Useful for major initiatives, cross-functional efforts, or awards.
```
[Project Title / Role] — Company, City, State
• Objective or scope
• Your contributions
• Outcome or measurable results
```

### 6. Education
```
Degree, Major — School Name, City, State
Graduation Month/Year
```

### 7. References
"Available upon request" (or include if specifically asked)

## Key Constraints

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Max 2 pages** | Recruiters skim - respect their time |
| **Max 10-15 years experience** | Older roles rarely matter |
| **Keyword optimization** | ATS systems scan for specific terms |
| **Quantified achievements** | Numbers prove impact |
| **No "References" section** | It's assumed; wastes space |

---

## Results > Responsibilities (Critical)

*From a recruiter with 18 years experience + 10 years as career coach:*

> "98% of all resumes read just like a job description."

**The problem:** Most people list tasks. Hiring managers want proof of value.

**The fix:** Lead with results, not responsibilities.

| Bad (Task-focused) | Good (Results-focused) |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Managed team of developers | Led team of 4 developers, reducing bug backlog by 60% in 3 months |
| Responsible for customer support | Resolved 150+ customer issues monthly, improving satisfaction scores from 3.2 to 4.7 |
| Handled data analysis | Built reporting dashboard that identified $200K in cost savings |

**Key questions for each bullet:**
- What problem did you solve?
- How did you resolve client/company issues?
- What process did you develop or improve?
- What was the measurable outcome?

**Show don't tell:** Don't claim value in your summary - prove it in your experience bullets.

## ATS Optimization Tips

1. Look at job postings in your target industry
2. Identify common keywords in responsibilities and qualifications
3. Integrate those naturally into your resume
4. Use standard section headings (ATS expects them)
5. Avoid tables, columns, graphics in ATS submissions (use ATS themes)

## How This Applies to prettify-ai

### Sample Content
The default/example resume should follow this structure - teaches best practices by example.

### Theme Selection Guidance
- **Standard themes**: Great for direct submissions, portfolios, networking
- **ATS themes**: Required for online applications through company portals

### What We Don't Do (Intentionally)
- Resume writing/generation (users bring content)
- Keyword optimization/scoring (other tools do this)
- Structure validation (too opinionated)

**Our job**: Take well-structured content → output professionally formatted documents.

## Competitive Landscape

**Research later:**
- **TailorCV** (u/rottbuildsAI) - AI tool that scores and rewrites resumes based on ATS logic
  - Potential complementary tool (they optimize content, we format output)
  - Validated our sample structure as "human-readable version of what ATS wants"

**prettify-ai positioning:**
```
User writes content → [TailorCV optimizes] → prettify-ai formats for export
```

We're the formatting layer, not the content optimization layer.
